# PlayFirstSubmitLater
Allows for automated elective score submission, including preventing submission of failed NF scores

Ever received trolly requests that you regret entertaining and now you have crap all over your ScoreSaber? Or is 14star OV forever dragging down your rank acc because your friends ran the map in MP while you went to eat? Too bad, no one can help you with those, but at least you can stop it from happening again! 
This mod means you can play all the shitmaps and practice high stars with reckless abandon. No longer will you scream when finally pass OV but it was in practice mode, nor when you didn't manage to click Pause fast enough to quit a run.

# How To Use
- Place PlayFirst.dll in Plugins folder. If a score is disabled, it will not be set locally nor submitted to ScoreSaber.
- **Submit Later:** Allows you to disable score submission from the Pause Menu. Automatically pauses at the end of the map to you can make your decision. Safety feature requires 2 clicks to disable score. Your decision for the run is final so choose wisely :) Only for Solo Mode.
- **NoFail Protection:** Stops score submission if you fail while playing on NF. Not enabled in Campaigns as some require NF modifier.
- **Disable All Score Submission:** No scores will be set. For all modes.
